# Logging Conventions (Sample Rule)

This is a sample rule to demonstrate how Cursor Rules work.

## Purpose
This rule applies to TypeScript and JavaScript files and provides guidance on logging.

## Guidelines

When adding logging statements:
- Use descriptive messages that explain **what** is happening
- Include relevant context variables
- Use appropriate log levels:
  - `error` for errors that need attention
  - `warn` for potential issues
  - `info` for general information
  - `debug` for detailed diagnostic information

## Example

**Good:**
```typescript
console.log('User authentication successful', { userId, timestamp });
```

**Avoid:**
```typescript
console.log('here'); // Too vague
```

## Notes
This rule demonstrates:
- ✅ Frontmatter metadata with `globs` and `description`
- ✅ Markdown formatting
- ✅ Practical coding guidance
- ✅ File pattern matching (applies only to .ts, .js, .tsx, .jsx files)
